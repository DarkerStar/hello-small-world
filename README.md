This project is a collection of "Hello, world!" programs, in various languages,
using various techniques, for the purpose of demonstrating different styles,
and comparing source and executable (as generated from default tools) sizes.

All programs (should) do exactly the same thing:

*   write the string `Hello, world!` - with precisely that punctuation -
    followed by a newline to `stdout`;
    
*   then check the result of the write operation, and return `0` if it succeeded
    and `1` if it failed.
